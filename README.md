# YouTube Playlist Analyzer

This Next.js application allows users to analyze YouTube playlists, displaying video information and a view count graph.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Install shadcn/ui components:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   ```
4. Add required components:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input card
   ```
5. Add PLaywright framework
   ```bash
   npx playwright install    

## Key Features

- Server-side YouTube playlist scraping using Crawlee
- Client-side playlist data visualization
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Important Files

- `app/page.tsx`: Main component with UI and client-side logic
- `app/api/scrape-playlist/route.ts`: API route for playlist scraping
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration

## Crawlee and Next.js Configuration

To make Crawlee work with Next.js, we use a custom webpack configuration in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (isServer) {
      config.externals.push(
        "crawlee",
        "puppeteer",
        "playwright",
        "puppeteer-core",
        "playwright-core"
      );
    }
    return config;
  },
};
```

This configuration externalizes Crawlee and related packages on the server-side to prevent build issues.

## UUID Strategy

To prevent Crawlee from caching requests, we use a UUID for each scraping operation:

1. Generate a UUID for each request
2. Use the UUID in the Crawlee request's `uniqueKey`
3. Include the UUID in the dataset name

This ensures that each scraping operation is treated as unique, even for the same playlist URL.

## Caveats and Notes

1. The app requires a server environment capable of running Playwright for scraping.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`crawlee`, `uuid`, `@types/uuid`).
3. The scraping process may take some time for large playlists.
4. Be mindful of YouTube's terms of service when using this app.
5. The app uses shadcn/ui components, which are built on top of Tailwind CSS. Make sure Tailwind is properly configured in your project.

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment

Before deploying, ensure your hosting environment supports server-side scraping with Playwright. You may need to install additional dependencies or use a specialized deployment platform.
